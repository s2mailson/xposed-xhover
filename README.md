####**Read more about xHover [HERE](http://blog.shubhangrathore.com/xhover/).**

Android app based on Xposed framework, to customize Paranoid Android's Hover notification experience. xHover works with any android firmware that has Hover notifications enabled.

Hover notifications are elegant visual overlays of notifications at status bar, implemented by [Paranoid Android's](https://plus.google.com/+ParanoidAndroidCorner/posts) development team. One of the most innovative features in Android Kitkat (4.4+) firmware, Hover notification **reimagines** the way we interact with notifications on our devices.
